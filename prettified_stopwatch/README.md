# Prettified Stopwatch

Expand the [stopwatch project](../chapter_projects/stopwatch/) from this chapter. The output should be formatted consistently to ensure the data can easily be read. Finally, use the `pyperclip` module to copy the text output to the clipboard so the user can quickly paste the output to a text file or email.
