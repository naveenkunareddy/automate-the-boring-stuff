# Random Chore Assignment Emailer

This program takes a list of chores and a list of emails and allocates the chores randomly across the emails. After the chores have been allocated, emails are sent to the respective recipients to specify which tasks have been assigned. 

This implementation relies on environment variables for the email credentials.
