# Filling in the Gaps
Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix, such as _spam001.txt_, _spam002.txt_, and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering (such as if there is a _spam001.txt_ and _spam003.txt_ but no _spam002.txt_). Have the program rename all the later files to close this gap.
