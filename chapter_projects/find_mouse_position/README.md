# “Where Is the Mouse Right Now?”

Being able to determine the mouse position is an important part of setting up your GUI automation scripts. But it’s almost impossible to figure out the exact coordinates of a pixel just by looking at the screen. It would be handy to have a program that constantly displays the x- and y-coordinates of the mouse cursor as you move it around.

Additionally, it would be handy for this program to grab the RGB color value of the pixel at the cursor's location.

At a high level, here’s what your program should do:
- Display the current x- and y-coordinates and RGB value of the mouse cursor
- Update these coordinates and RGB value as the mouse moves around the screen
