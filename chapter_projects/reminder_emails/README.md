# Sending Member Dues Reminder Emails

Say you have been “volunteered” to track member dues for the Mandatory Volunteerism Club. This is a truly boring job, involving maintaining a spreadsheet of everyone who has paid each month and emailing reminders to those who haven’t. Instead of going through the spreadsheet yourself and copying and pasting the same email to everyone who is behind on dues, let’s—you guessed it—write a script that does this for you.

At a high level, here’s what your program will do:
- Read data from an Excel spreadsheet
- Find all members who have not paid dues for the latest month
- Find their email addresses and send them personalized reminders
