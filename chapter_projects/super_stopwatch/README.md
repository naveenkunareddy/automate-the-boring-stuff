# Super Stopwatch

Say you want to track how much time you spend on boring tasks you haven’t automated yet. You don’t have a physical stopwatch, and it’s surprisingly difficult to find a free stopwatch app for your laptop or smartphone that isn’t covered in ads and doesn’t send a copy of your browser history to marketers.

At a high level, here’s what your program will do:
- Track the amount of time elapsed between presses of the ENTER key, with each key press starting a new “lap” on the timer
- Print the lap number, total time, and lap time
