# Map It

This is what your program does:
* Gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard
* Opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address

This means your code will need to do the following:
* Read the command line arguments from `sys.argv`
* Read the clipboard contents
* Call the `webbrowser.open()` function to open the web browser

## Sample Arguments and Output
