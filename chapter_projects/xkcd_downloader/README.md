# XKCD Comic Downloader

XKCD is a popular geek webcomic. This is a simple script that downloads the available comics hosted on [XKCD.com](https://xkcd.com).

Here's what the program does:
- Loads the XKCD home page
- Saves the comic image on that page to an XKCD directory
- Follows the Previous Comic link
- Repeats until it reaches the first comic

This project is a good example of a program that can automatically follow links in order to scrape large amounts of data from the Web.
