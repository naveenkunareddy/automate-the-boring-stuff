# Identifying Photo Folders on the Hard Drive

Write a program that goes through every folder on your hard drive and finds potential photo folders. Of course, first you’ll have to define what you consider a “photo folder” to be; let’s say that it’s any folder where more than half of the files are photos. And how do you define what files are photos?

First, a photo file must have the file extension .png or .jpg. Also, photos are large images; a photo file’s width and height must both be larger than 500 pixels. This is a safe bet, since most digital camera photos are several thousand pixels in width and height.

When the program runs, it should print the absolute path of any photo folders to the screen.
